# Bachelor-s-Thesis
Repository for the code I wrote and used for my Bachelor's Thesis titled "On the Longest Common Subsequence between two random correlated strings".

It includes a C++ file with code that takes as input a parameter h determining the maximum memory each state can hold and generates the corresponding Markov Chain (see Section 4 of the final report). It also includes a Mathematica Notebook which takes the Markov Chain and symbolically calculates its stable state distribution, as well as the average contribution of each state to the output. Finally, it computes the weighted average of these contributions.

The ouput of the C++ file is already formatted so as to be directly pastable to the Mathematica Notebook.
